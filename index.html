      <h2 class="card-title">Passion</h2>
      <p class="card-text">In the realm of automotive enthusiasts, a car club is more than just a group of individuals who share a passion for cars; it's a tight-knit 
        community built on commitment and a shared love for all things automotive. The commitment towards a car club transcends the mere ownership of a vehicle; it embodies a profound dedication to a lifestyle that revolves around engines, aesthetics, and the camaraderie of like-minded individuals.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">What we do</h2>
      <p>In our car club, we do more than just drive; we do more than just admire. We live and breathe the automotive lifestyle. We come together to celebrate our shared passion, to learn, to explore, and to make a positive impact on the world around us. It's not just about what 
        we drive; it's about the journey we take together, both on and off the road</p>
